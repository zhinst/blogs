## How to Generate QAM Signaling with the HDAWG

The contents of this folder belong to the blog post [How to Generate QAM Signaling with the HDAWG Arbitrary Waveform Generator](https://www.zhinst.com/blogs/how-generate-qam-signaling-hdawg-arbitrary-waveform-generator).

The file [QAM_signal_generation.seqc](QAM_signal_generation.seqc) contains a basic example of QAM signal generation.

The file [QAM_eye_pattern.seqc](QAM_eye_pattern.seqc) generates a random BPSK pattern for eye and constellation visualization.
