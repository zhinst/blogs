## Waveform Precision in Picoseconds: Subsampling Techniques with Zurich Instruments QCCS

The contents of this folder belong to the blog post [Waveform Precision in Picoseconds: Subsampling Techniques with Zurich Instruments QCCS](https://www.zhinst.com/blogs/waveform-precision-picoseconds-subsampling-techniques-zurich-instruments-qccs).

The Jupyter notebook [subsampling.ipynb](subsampling.ipynb) describes how to implement subsampling; the support file [subsampling.py](subsampling.py) implements the filter calculations for subsampling.
