## Generation of wideband SSB and DSB modulations using AWG

The contents of this folder belong to the blog post [Generation of Single-Sideband Modulation by Arbitrary Waveform Generators](https://www.zhinst.com/node/1945).

The file [SSB_DSB_UHFLI.seqc](SSB_DSB_UHFLI.seqc) contains an example SSB and DSB generated signals for the UHFLI instrument.

The file [SSB_DSB_HDAWG.seqc](SSB_DSB_HDAWG.seqc) is the same, but tailored for the HDAWG instrument.
